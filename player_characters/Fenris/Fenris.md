## Backstory

Hailing from the small wooded village of Faundell, Fenris always dreamed of adventure. He applied himself to his studies, trained with the bow, and spent countless hours tracing the lines of the surrounding wilderness until the undergrowth was a second home. Where there was trouble, he stepped in and stood up for what was right, and he gained some local renown for various acts of monster scaring, pet rescuing, and general doing of good.

Yet it felt small. So small.

Word floated through Faundell of a far off Guild, fighting the battles that needed to be fought and facing danger head on. Fenris set off the next day without looking back.
