## Background

Leal'tad, also known to their friends as Lea, is best friends with Cheya Kov and Bart.

## Gen

Gen, full name Generator, is Leal'tad's adopted goblin. She is 5 years old and was found in the middle of a mission to retrieve Khajit's stolen painting. Leal'tad found Gen under a pile of dead goblins who were seemingly ritually sacrificed but the little goblin girl lived. On the spot Lea promised to keep Gen safe. As was tradition in Gen's tribe, they shook hands with blood.

That was the moment the contract was signed. Unbeknownst to the team at the time Generator was emacualtly birthed due to a devil's contract and was thus born fully a goblin and fully a fiend. Leal'tad had unknowing made a contract with Gen that harm would never come the goblin's way as long as they lived.
