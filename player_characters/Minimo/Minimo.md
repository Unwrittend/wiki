Minimo is a kangeroo mousekin wandering librarian. His goal make it easy for all people to find and learn the secrets for the world. He'd go from town to town helping sort their libraries and made them more accessible to the local populace. It is easy to forget the stories of heros if their stories are not written down. He came to the Lemurian Guild in order to help them write dossiers and clean up the Archives.

Minimo will have kleptomaniac episodes whenever he is frightened or threatened. He does not remember anything from the episodes.

Despite being scared of everything, Minimo calms down when he hears music. Enemies fear the lullaby sung from his lips when he enters murder mouse mode.

Over his time traveling he learned how to cook really well. He hopes that when he eventually dies he'll be cooked into a good stew.

## Kangeroo Mousekin Lore

Kangeroo Mousekin are reculsive, jumpy critters. Most of the time, they look exactly like a kangeroo rat but are significantly more intelligent. A few of them are comparatively giant. Tallmice as they are called, grow to be between 1.5-2.5 ft tall. Unlike their smaller counterparts, they CAN speak common. Tallice are often representatives for the smallfolk. They may be active guardians of smallfolk burrows or may travel between towns gathering winter supplies, but the vast majority of them are ambassadors. They try to create legal protections or carve out places for the small to live besides the tallfolk. This has rarely worked but they continue to hope it may someday.

Smallguard is a highly prestigous job that many smallfolk children aspire to be when they grow up. The smallguards protect hidden mousefolk villages from monsters but also regular predators like cats, raccoons, and owls. They are fearless. There is a childhood story of a 5 mouse team destroying a single eagle's nest. They worked together to craft rope, scaled a giant oak, and fought the eagle as if it was a dragon all in order to destroy the predator's nest. Smallguard keep the smallfolk safe from the many monsters that would see them as prey.

The greatest of smallguards are knighted and become retainers to the tallguards. As retainers, they act as accountants, watch mice, and the assistant for the tallmouse's ambassador needs.
