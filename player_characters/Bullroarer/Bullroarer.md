## Regaining his leg

Dirk cast a 7th level [Regenerate](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/regenerate) spell on Bullroarer to regrow his missing leg.

> "It pains my writing hand to see someone who isn't able to travel around and visit all of the places I talk about in my guide book. (Or only needs just one guide book since they can't travel far enough to need a new region.) So cast off that peg leg and roam again! Go forth and buy guid books for new regions!" - Dirk
