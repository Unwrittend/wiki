## Background

Reysatra is a Golden Dragonborn who was adopted by a family of wood elves when she was 5 years old. She doesn't talk much about her past before her new family. Due to her adoption into a Wood elf tribe, **she doesn't speak common well and only learned to read/write upon joining the Guild**. She is fluent in Elvish and Draconic, though no one has heard her speak in Draconic.

She is the adopted sister of Theren.

### Things of note

- She always wears clothing or armor which covers her arms and hands
- Is afraid of other Dragonborn
- Does not do well with crowds
- Has to drink a tea before missions to keep calm
- Loud noises trigger PTSD episodes
- Loves her brother and mother, and would do anything for them

## Appearance

A nearly 6 foot tall Golden Dragonborn stands before you. She wears full plate armor worn from use, covering all except her head. A crudely carved Oak tree is prominent on the chest and both pauldrons of the armor. A long sword hangs from her side, while a shield weirdly hangs from the other. The handle of a crossbow and another sword can be seen poking up from her back.

Her bright forest green eyes stare at you with uncertainty, the golden scales around her head appear to be glowing. Matching the glow of her scales the pendant around her neck shimmers with holy light, it is in the shape of an Oak tree as well
