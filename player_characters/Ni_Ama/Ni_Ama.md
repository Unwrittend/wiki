## Background

An Eladrin Druid from the Feywilds, she came over a short while after the Guild sent some members on an extended mission.
Little did they know that after their departure, the Court was abuzz with talk, tales, and fanfiction of the brave group.
Ni Ama, being a consummate explorer and plant cultivator/Wilds protector, used the possibility of exploring a new plane as a fantastic excuse to come through the portal and join the Guild.
Reality being she just wanted to meet all the hero's she had heard so many tales about.

## Spring

Ni Ama was a spring Eladrin when she entered the guild.

Spring Eladrins are the embodiment of new life, energy, and regrowth.
Flowers tend to bloom, and plants will sprout in her presence when excited or happy.

### Courting Theren

Ni Ama and Theren would share several tender moments and after several months began courting.

## Winter

Winter Eladrins are the embodiment of sadness, bitterness, and solemnity. Winterâ€™s chill emanates from her, and water in the air can freeze to snowflakes in response to her sorrow.

### Theren's Death

Ni Ama changed seasons to Winter after Theren's passing.

Since his death she has become more cold and cunning.
