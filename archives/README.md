The Lemurian Adventure Guild Archives is a repository of knowledge for Lemurian guild members. It contains a mixture of dossiers, notes, folders, and stories volenteers have compiled overtime.

If a person is lucky, they might find their answers in the Archives.

:::tip
The Archives are the in-game name for the wiki. It is maintained by volunteers.

Check the Archives for in-game history and you might be able to avoid spending time units on research :wink:.
