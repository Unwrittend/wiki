Welcome to the Lumerian Guild, this is **Penelope**. I will be your guide today you. Please join me while we explore everything we have to offer in the city.
:::

## Overview

The Lemurian Guild is located in the heart of Capital City. During your free time, you are welcome to explore the city and all it has to offer. You can find artisans, craftsmen, food, entertainment. Pretty much anything you could want. The main gate is the only way in or out and any attempts to teleport in or out of the guild will not work. The gate is constantly manned with guards who will permit you entry and exit.

## Garden

You proceed down the main path. Meticulously groomed flower beds, hedges, trees, and even a small pond line the walkway. Off across the grounds you see a rather large building and open dirt area.
The garden is primarily maintained by Guild members who find gardening relaxing in their downtime, and the Guild does pay a small stipend for work performed here.
Across the way are the training grounds. Inside the building you will find training weaponry, targets, and dummies for those practicing martial skills. The large dirt area is set aside for spellcasters to get a feel for their magics.

## Guild Hall

You enter the main Guild building. The guild's entrance hall is covered in paintings of famous battles and Guild members in heroic poses.
To the left here, as you all know, are the dorms. Each of you has your own room. On the right is the tavern. Across the entrance hall, up one side of the curving pair of grand staircases to the second floor where, you'll find the portal room.
The portal chamber allows the Lemurian Guild to send teams anywhere in the world in the blink of an eye. You must be registered in blood with the Guild or a magically bound companion or familiar to safely use the portal. Use of this portal is strictly monitored and you must receive authorization for a mission prior to use.

## Mission Board

You can find the mission board in the guild hall. Notices of missions and world events are updated here.

## Tavern

The tavern is paid for by one of our wealthy former members and free to all. Pretty much any drink you want can be found here. However, know that if you abuse this privilege, it can be taken away. There is also an open kitchen for those of you who destress by cooking or baking. Or you can take a shift either serving or cooking for a small payout.

## Library

The library is one of the most important spaces in the Guild. Over the years, we have amassed a vast collection of texts on nearly every topic imaginable. Here you can do research into the places, people, and creatures you may encounter during your missions. The head librarian, Jeremiah, can almost always point you in the right direction if you have a question you think the books can answer.

## The Exchange

Khajit keeps all manner of basic gear and equipment ready to sell in the exchange. Specialty magical items are harder to come by, especially with the current difficulties with shipping. However, he will sometimes announce auctions or sales if he manages to get something in, so keep an ear out for those. If there is a particular item you want, he has relationships with all sorts of magical craftsmen and can usually place an order on your behalf for a small commissioning fee.
The exchange also has a board where you can buy or sell from other guild members. Please add a notice here if that is the case. If you encounter any unclaimed items on your missions, you are free to bring them back here to have them appraised. He will identify them for a small fee, and usually offer to purchase that item from you.

## Debriefing Room

Now we come to the offices. Here is where you can file your debriefing reports after each mission, successful or not. All guild members, unless stated otherwise, have access to these reports and can reference them at a later time.
Depending on the sensitivity of the information from your debriefs, you may also request to submit your debriefs to Wendy and Gideon behind closed doors (in your private channel). Although if you choose to do this, know that the rest of the guild will not have access to that information.

## The Archives

The archives are adjoined to the debriefing room if you need to look through past filings.

## The Memorial Hall

And our last stop is the memorial hall. It's a cavernous room with neat rows of marble slabs. Each slab has two hundred names carved into them. Benches are scattered throughout and there are a few neutral altars where different rituals could be set up.
You may visit the [memorial](/memorial) to view the obituaries of our fallen comrades and read of their adventures from those that knew them best.
