# Conjure Animals

- [Original Spell Description](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/conjure-animals)

## Modifications

### Number of Animals

Reduced number of animals for CR 1/4 and CR 1/2:

> Choose one of the following options for what appears:
>
> - One beast of challenge rating 2 or lower
> - Two beasts of challenge rating 1 or lower
> - <strike>Four</strike> Three beasts of challenge rating 1/2 or lower
> - <strike>Eight</strike> Four beasts of challenge rating 1/4 or lower

### Animal Choice

The player may choose the animals conjured, instead of the DM. However, the player must have the statblocks available for any animal they choose, and the DM must agree that the animals are appropriate to use.

Ideally the player will agree in advance with the DM on which animals that their character should be able to conjure.

### Initiative

The player may choose to have the conjured animals use an initiative in combat immediately after the character's, instead of rolling separate initiative.

### Courtesy

Any player using this spell should be mindful of time taken and table friendliness. Conjure Animals can be tricky to use without overwhelming a table or a DM, and wherever possible, the player should try to make things easy and fun for all parties.

They may consider:

- Using dice rollers or otherwise optimizing dice rolls for attacks, damage, etc (roll in advance, mob rules)
- Avoiding or somehow speeding up rider effects (watch out for excessive saves)
- Grouping conjured animals (2 groups of 2, etc) for simplicity
- Using averaged HP and damage
