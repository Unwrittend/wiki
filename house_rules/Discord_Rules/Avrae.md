[Avrae](https://avrae.io/) is a Discord bot for D&D used to roll dice and ability checks in the Lemurian Discord server.

## Setting up

Use `!import [dndbeyond character hyperlink]` where the [dndbeyond character hyperlink] is your DNDBeyond character's share hyperlink. This loads your character into Avrae. Once the character is imported, you can use avrae commands.

Below is an example of where the share link is.
