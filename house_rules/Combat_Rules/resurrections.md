# Resurrections

Resurrection spells such as [Raise Dead](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/raise-dead), [Resurrection](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/resurrection), [True Resurrection](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/true-resurrection), and [Reincarnate](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/reincarnate) are not usable spells in this game world/setting. If your character would normally access to this spell, please talk to the DMs in your private channel to discuss an alternative.

[Revivify](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/revivify) is a usable spell with the following adjustments:

- Component cost is 1,500gp (must be purchased in advance).
- When a character is revived in this way, they take a -3 penalty on all d20 rolls.
- This penalty is reduced by 1 every time they complete a long rest.
- Casting Revivify at a higher spell level reduces the penalty by 1 for every spell level higher than 3rd.

There are rumors of a necromancer named [Rakkar](../../npcs/rakkar) who can provide preventative measures against death for a fee. If you are wearing one of his soul crystals, you can be restored to life after death, back to a previously checkpointed level.

## Replacement Characters

When making a character to replace one that has died, your new character starts at level 1 but their level up thresholds will be halved.
This effect lasts until the new character reaches the `level of your former character + 1`.

:::tip Example
Max dies at level 5.
My new character Ned will pay 1/2 the normal gold cost to level up until he reaches level 6.
