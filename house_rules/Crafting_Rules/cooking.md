## Cooking Magical Meals

You may spend your downtime cooking a magical meal for up to 5 people to enjoy. Magical meals provide effects on the next mission, expiring at the start of the next rest period. Cooking the meal requires 1 time unit and the cook must be proficient in `Chefâ€™s Tools`. Eating the meal requires 1 time unit (chefs must also spend this time unit to eat if they wish to partake). The chef determines the strength of the effect, those who eat the meal enjoy the effects.

Before beginning the meal, you must purchase the ingredients, and commit to the chefs and the diners. All gold and time units are spent up front before making any rolls. If multiple chefâ€™s participate in the cooking, they each make a separate Chefâ€™s Tools (**wis**) check. The highest chefâ€™s roll is used to determine the quality of the meal, but each subsequent chef adds a -2 penalty to the overall meal.
