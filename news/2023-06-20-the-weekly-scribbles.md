## Lord John Calls for Big Game Hunters

Lord John of Sherwood is putting out a national call for any thrill seeking hunters to come to his territory to hunt large apes. He is turning it into a contest offering 50gp per head, and an additional 100gp to the person who kills the most of the creatures. Lord John recently began a lumber project to cut down a large swath of Sherwood Forest and convert it into farmland. The project has been stalling, partially due to encounters with the apes injuring workers and damaging equipment. Now it appears his solution is to call in hunters who enjoy the sport and declaring open season.

## King Hosts Delegation From Hershey

The Shah of the Hershey Empire is visiting the Kingdom this week. King Rudolph and the royal family welcomed the Shah and his delegation outside the palace. This has been touted as a cultural exchange with several well publicized events occurring around the capital, but it is likely that several state conversations will also take place behind closed doors. Lemuria has maintained a shaky peace with Hershey, but reports of unrest within the Empire are growing. The Resurgence Faction has been gaining momentum, touting a desire to return Hershey to the prominence of the Empire's heyday two millennia ago.

## Phantom Thieves Strike Again

In Xanthium, local businesses are reeling from another theft by the mysterious phantom thieves. Cece Carmel's studio, one of the premier dressmakers in Lemuria, was the target this time. Cece was outraged, calling for the local police to do their jobs and catch the 'vermin' who made off with several jewel encrusted dresses and thousands of gold coinage. As per their modus operandi, the thieves left a calling card denouncing Cece and Carmel Studios for preying on desperate workers and paying them low wages to toil in awful work conditions. Cece maintains that her business is perfectly legal and her workers are happy to accept the jobs.
