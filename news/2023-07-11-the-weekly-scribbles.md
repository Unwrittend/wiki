## Unification Day Festivities Come to a Close

Yesterday the 514th Unification Day Festival officially came to a close. In addition to the usual favorites of the parade, grand market, and royal address, this year also saw the return of the Unification Day Concert. Alvis Parsley headlined the show accompanied by a number of musical acts from around the kingdom to showcase the various cultures of our nation. Fans were disappointed that Alvis only played a few songs. The entertainer says that he wanted to share the spotlight with the other acts in the spirit of kingdom unity. The Royal Family also made appearances around the Festival. It was one of the first public appearances of Queen Rose after mourning the untimely passing of Princess Charlotte.

After the continued setbacks, shareholders are beginning to grumble that a change of leadership may be required to turn things around for ARI.

When asked about the recent spate of terrorist attacks at various military outposts around the kingdom, both the General and the Guild refused to comment.
