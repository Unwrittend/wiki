## Alderaan Continues to Struggle with Poverty, Homelessness

The city of Alderaan has been slow to recover after a sudden swarm of mephit monsters raged through and destroyed or damaged several districts. Although the Lemurian Guild was able to respond quickly to neutralize the threat, they could not wholly prevent the loss of life and property. The Kindgom has granted aid from the emergency fund, but one year later the money has dried up and a large swathe of the city remains mired in poverty. Interviews with those living there indicate that most of the people there are the injured and displaced from the attack who did not receive sufficient aid and have nowhere else to go. Unwilling or unable to leave the city, they have been forced to scramble to survive amidst the rubble. Alderaan city officials state that they are “taking the problem very seriously,” but their programs and attempts to help have fallen short thus far.

## Venomous Spider Infestation in Surwood

Ecologists were baffled this week when they began hearing of a large number of strange spiders that appeared overnight in Surwood. They quickly investigated and estimated that several hundred non-native species of Black Widow had spread over several acres in the heart of the forest. While surveying, the ecology team of Johnson and Perkins were met with members of the Lemurian Guild who stated they were the ones who brought these spiders here. They believed the spiders were in danger in their previous habitat and decided to relocate them to Surwood. Johnson and Perkins are unsure of the impact these non-native spiders will have on the local ecology. “As far as we are aware, this is an unprecedented situation. We will monitor the situation carefully and publish the results as soon as we are able. In the meantime, citizens are warned to avoid the center of Surwood as these spider’s bite can be dangerous and potentially fatal.

## Goblin Warband Defeated in Thebes

The Kingdom Army routed a goblin warband that was threatening the Thebes territory. The goblin forces mustered and marched on Thyrsus, the largest city in the territory. A crudely written manifesto stated that the warband intended to establish a goblin city as a safe haven for all goblinoids who live in fear throughout Lemuria. The Kingdom Army garrisoned at Hebring moved quickly and intercepted the warband before they could reach the city. Several battles occurred in the forests and hills before the Kingdom Army managed to push the goblin forces out into the open plains where mounted calvary units were able to break through the enemy lines and break the back of the warband. General Cassius organized the assault and credits the valor of his men for the victory. “We are here to maintain peace and stability for Lemuria. My men fought bravely and with honor to defend their homeland,” he said in his official statement.
