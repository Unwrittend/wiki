## Prince of Carmel Kingdom Arrives

Prince Anthony, heir to the Carmel Kingdom, arrived at the capital this week. On the agenda are several cultural exchange events and several closed-door meetings regarding trade and military. This visit comes only two weeks after Lemuria hosted a delegation from the Hershey Empire. Hershey and Carmel have a long and storied past dating back to the original Carmel Empire and tensions remain between the two nations. The King has promised the Council of Nobles that he will not drag Lemuria into the middle of their conflict, but will maintain open dialogue with all parties.

## Dutchess of Ylisse Emmeryn Assassinated

In the dead of night, an assassin infiltrated the Citadel of Ylisse and succeeded in killing the Dutchess, Emmeryn. Emmeryn was well loved by her subjects and pioneered several desperately needed aide programs to help the weakest within her domain. Reports suggest it was a lone assassin who slipped past the Citadel’s formidable defenses, and it was only the quick thinking of young Lord Chrom to rally the guard that he and his sister were not also killed in the attack. The assassin utilized powerful magic to plunge the area into darkness before killing the Dutchess, much like the one that killed Lord Edmund several months ago. Authorities are determining if this was indeed the same perpetrator. After the mourning period, Lord Chrom will become the next Duke of Ylisse.

## New Discovery Ruins of Carmel Empire

A source within a research team has leaked that a new set of ruins dating back to the Holy Carmel Empire have just been found submerged in Lake Lochmorse. Last month archeologists found a set of sealed journals from the Empire’s time and based on the writings they guessed that the area once held a holy site. The area around Lake Lochmorse had been well explored, leading the research team to examine the lakebed. Sure enough, they found a sunken temple. Whether the temple was built there or due to the earth shifting it wound up there is still undetermined. Famed Archeologist and explorer Carolina Tomes is still missing, and so the Guild was called to sweep the temple for traps.
