# Snorkels

## Background

Snorkels is a monkey faced menace upon society.
It can occasionally be seen shoving creatures into a seemingly bottomless bag of holding.
Whenever Snorkels is found either in the guildhall or on a guild member's mission, it will pull out creatures from its bag.

The Guild provides hazard pay to guild members who minimize the damage of "Snorkels Events".
