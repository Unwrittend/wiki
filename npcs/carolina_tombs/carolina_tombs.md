## Background

Carolina Tomes, archeologist extraordinaire and occasional lecturer at the Institute of Magic, was researching the relics and history related to the Holy Caramel Empire. On the mission right before her disappearance, 'Carolina' was in possession of a staff that once belonged to the Holy Caramel Emperor. We learned that the real Carolina had gone missing and have not heard or seen 'Carolina' since.

## Previous Missions

### Raiders of the Lost Tomb

CR: 6

Background: Carolina Tomes, archeologist extraordinaire, has just discovered this tomb from the Holy Carmel Empire. She believes it to be the resting place of one of the Emperors! She wants you to move through and clear all the traps in the path so she can safely remove any artifacts she finds and take her time examining the ruins. This mission may require multiple attempts to clear out all of the traps.

### Carolina Tomes and the Hidden Temple

CR: 5

Background: Carolina Tomes has deciphered some ancient maps and murals and is certain there is a temple of the Holy Carmel Empire hidden up a cavern river running under the mountains. She needs some help with getting there and exploring whatâ€™s inside.

Objective: Help Carolina investigate the temple. This will likely take several runs to fully explore, so take good notes. Make sure you return Carolina to the base camp safely before you are pulled back to the Guild.
