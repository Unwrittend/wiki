# Rakkar al BashÃ¬r

![Rakkar](Rakkar.png)

Rakkar is a necromancer that occasionally will show up in town every few months. Little is known about him aside from the rumors that he can provide you a second chance at life if you purchase his unique soul crystals.

It is believed that his family line has connections to powerful magic from the Holy Carmel Empire.

> "I was on a mission wearing a necklace made from the crystal shard. I died, but when I came to, my party was surrounding me shocked. They said the crystal on my necklace cracked by itself the moment I died. It took some time, but I came back, just like Rakkar promised!"

> "Knowledge of the process was lost with the fall of the Holy Carmel Empire. BUT Magic Brian did found out that the magic involved is somehow tied to a specific family line, 'Al Bashir'. "

> He said he was going to move on very soon, so if you want such a stone then you should get in touch immediately. He said he would show up maybe twice a year, but according to a calendar in a different world."
