The Tavern Trio are three young ladies who ran the Guild Tavern.
When they were younger, each was saved by [Alvis](alvis) and sent to work within the Guild Hall as a safety measure.
They have since been kidnapped by the Syndicate and only Rikku has been rescued.

The guild has been searching for clues on where they are being held.
They uncovered a ritual where Yuna was being held in the center.
The whole guild mobilized to disrupt the ritual.
As the ritual was about to come to fruition, Feirfiz slew Yuna, preventing her from being transformed into The Black Dragon.

Later, Rikku was discovered to be working with the Syndicate to develop their alchemical soldier program. She was rescued and returned to the Guild, but has been damaged by the experience and is under a Devil's Contract.

## Backstories

### Yuna

As a child, Yuna was rescued from the Invictus Syndicate by Alvis. He raised her alongside Rikku and Paine. Yuna was the hostess at the Lemurian Guild Tavern, and served as a Lemurian Guild liaison, and even started going on missions for the Lemurian Guild at the age 14. When the Guild was invaded by the Syndicate, she along with Rikku and Paine were taken captive. She was kept in a dungeon in the catacombs under the Goodwitch family mansion as a potential Black Dragon vessel candidate. The Guild tried to rescue her twice, but was unsuccessful. Ultimately she was slain by Feirfiz in the Swamps of Duloc before she was forcefully awakened as the Black Dragon. With her last dying breath, she thanked Fierfiz before passing on in his arms.

### Rikku

Alive and Traumatized

Rikku comes from a family of caravan traders who knew how to cross the Great Desert. At age 6, she was orphaned when a blue dragon attacked the caravan and ended up an urchin in the Holy Caramel Empire. She was taken in by Alvis and brought to the Lemuriuan Guild where she was raised alongside Yuna and Paine. At age 14, Rikku began doing missions for the Guild. Additionally she served as a waitress at the Guild's Tavern as well as the Guild's in-house alchemist. When the Invictus Syndicate infiltrated the Guild, Rikku was taken captive along with Paine and Yuna. She was put under multiple layers of Gaess while she was with the Syndicate. She worked with [Dr. Mauro (Doc)](../syndicate/Dr_Mauro_Doc) to develope the super soldier serum.

She was rescured and taken back to the Lemurian Guild where the guild successfully dispelled the Gaess. She has since spent her time in recovery. Currently, Rikku is working on a neutralizing agent for the super soldier serum.

> "Hmmm, that's an interesting question." Rikku leans back on the bench and kicks her legs a little. "I think I was 6 at the time. My parents were caravan traders who knew how to make the crossing of the Great Desert. One day, a blue dragon attacked the caravan. I ended up pinned underneath one of the wagons, but it meant the dragon never noticed me. I was the only one to survive. After the dragon left, I pulled together whatever I could from the wreckage and waited for another caravan to come through. I bartered my way onto it and ended up in the Hershey Empire with nothing but the torn dress on my back. Things were... bad there. I ended up stealing to survive and found out I was pretty good at it. So when I saw a guy in fancy clothes strutting around, I though I'd try my luck. Turned out it was Alvis. He caught me in a second, of course. I was so scared, I thought for sure I was about to lose a hand. But instead, he asked if I wanted a job. He gave me some simple little tasks to do, but he made them sound so important, and in exchange he gave me all the food I could eat and a new dress. When he was leaving I begged him to take me along, and so I wound up here. I picked up things here and there just watching people train when I had time. When we got a little older, my sisters and I started begging for them to let us take missions. It wasn't until we were 14 they finally let us take some of the low risk ones. So there, 16 years ago if you're asking when I first came here, 8 years since I became an official member." - Rikku
