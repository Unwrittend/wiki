## Description

A Wood elf stands before you, his coffee eyes showing disinterest in all around him even though his face is smiling serenely. Oddly, he does not have any weapons or armor within sight, instead he is wearing brown and dark green vestments, which has a golden Oak tree embroidered on the chest. The green of the vestments compliments his hair and goatee, being a 2 shades lighter in color. His copper skin has no blemishes except for an intricate tattoo on his right hand, which glows when he introduces himself.

## Background

Theren is the first born of his family, being born from loving parents. His love for learning had him originally pursuing a career in research before his Life Cleric powers were revealed at the age of 35. It was a blessing in disguise, since it allowed him to roam the world on different pilgrimages, seeing quite a bit the world has to offer.

He was ecstatic to welcome his baby sister, and devastated with her death a few years later when the village was attacked by raiders. This lead to him meeting his adopted little sister, Reysatra.

    Bart used to say weird stuff like Theren x Ni Ama and Therama and "ships". This must be investigated further. - Minimo

</Admonition>

### Things of note:

- He has no regrets regarding his actions, if Reysatra is happy
- The tattoo glows when he introduces himself, so long as he is not being controlled
- Was forcefully married and has 2 children
- Cares for his mother
- **Do not mess with Reysatra when he is present**

## Life in the Guild

Theren caught the eye of fellow guild member Ni Ama and courted her for a time.

## Death

Theren went on a mission with several veteran guild members to clear out a kruthik hive. Several kruthiks realized he was a threat and proceeded to slash him along the belly in the final moments of the battle. Guildmembers saw him go down but was breathing at the time the portal pulled the team back. However, they found he died inbetween the moments the portal took him back and it brought him back to the guildhall.

:::warning Avrae is fair and just
A natural 1 death save killed Theren on the portal back home. **Avrae is fair and just**.
:::

Ni Ama and Reysatra prepared and brought his body to the memorial ceremony.

Following the ceremony his ashes were planted in the garden and became a feywilds pine tree.

### Memorial

<img src="../img/players/Theren_memorial.jpg" alt="Theren" width="600"/>

#### Chuck

> _Chuck silently glides into the memorial room, dressed in her nun‚Äôs habit. She also takes a seat. She didn‚Äôt know Theren well, only attending one clean up mission where he drove the cart that she was guarding. Oh, and there was that Snorkles Mission, too. But she saw him in the infirmary. A lot. He was attentive to his patients. Researching many hours into tomes way above her comprehension. Chuck may not have made a deep connection with Theren but she does know Ni Ama. And her heart breaks because she knows that the loss of Theren is almost killing her friend._
>
> _Sister Charles (now in the dress befitting of her formal name)slowly arises from her seat in the back. She comes forward in a stately manner befitting the solemnity of the occasion to the podium_
>
> ‚ÄúDear faithful hearted Theren. Healer. Protector. Lover of trees. Child of the wood and wind. Guardian of the weak, the vulnerable, the downtrodden. Faithful in performing your duties with excellence and diligence. You risked your life so many times to save others, including mine. Your clear thinking, fierce love of sister and friend, made you respected by all in this guild. You will be fondly remembered as the face of the infirmary as you cared for your patients as thoroughly there as upon the battle field. Know that you will be missed. Know that what you loved and guarded‚Ä¶‚Äù
>
> _here she looks at Rey and Ni Ama_
>
> ‚Äú‚Ä¶will be cherished, loved and guarded in your stead by those who remain. Sleep long and rest, our model and inspiration of what it means to be a guild member.‚Äù
>
> Sister Charles now steps from the podium to offer her sincerest condolences to Rey and Ni Ama in the form of a long and tearful hug.

#### Draven

> _Draven walks after resting from his guard duty he seems tough but a little teary-eyed_
>
> _He brought some roses and many flowers with him_ > _He most likely "found" in the garden_ > _Draven leaves the flowers in the coffin_
>
> "Theren I may have not known you for long but I respected how you have that smile that hided how you feel in order to help others"

#### Tar'kiz

> _You notice on the stage under the portrait is what looks like a replica Tar'kiz's turret. Tar'kiz is nowhere to be seen, however._

#### Reysatra

> _Sitting in the front row are Ni Ama and Reysatra, Reysatra is still clutching onto Ni Ama's sleeve with an iron grip._
>
> _With jerky movements she moves to a standing position, awkwardly and slowly approaching the podium. She looks at Theren's portrait for a moment, before turning to address the crowd. She looks terrified and defeated, yet she is attempting a smile_
>
> \<\<Thank you all for coming to remember Hanar I mean Theren's life. He would be shocked by the amount of people who are in attendance,, he was hard to get along with because of his prickly personality\>\> _She moves her hands awkwardly - not knowing if her joke came through... Though she may have forgotten not everyone can speak Elvish_
>
> \<\<He cared about people, yet never letting anyone get close. And once you were he had no problem protecting you with everything he had\>\> _a choked sob_ \<\<Well, thank you for attending, please feel free to share your thoughts\>\>
>
> _Piece now said, she moves to prostrate herself before the image, whisper Elvish being heard along with sobbing_

#### Leono

> _Leono didn‚Äôt understand a word but sees Reysatra sobbing and hurried up to comfort her. He kneels by her, places a hand on her shoulder, shares small reassurances and condolences, and resolves to stay by her as long as she needs someone there._

#### Fenris

> _Fenris follows, and Leono gives him a nod to speak on both of their behalfs._
>
> ‚ÄúWe are all so saddened and shocked by the loss of Theren. Like Reysatra said, it was maybe hard for some of us to know him well, so protective that he was of himself. But you could not help but admire how he enveloped those he loved in that same level of protection. He would do anything to keep Rey and Ni Ama safe, and there was no doubting his strength to keep his word there. He kept so many of the rest of us in the Guild safe and healthy, even as just part of his very distant extended family. This world is a worse place without him.‚Äù
>
> ‚ÄúNi Ama, Rey, I‚Äôm so sorry. Where Theren was, we will be there for you, but I know it‚Äôs a sorry replacement.‚Äù
>
> _Fenris steps down, while Leono stays silently by Reysatra._

#### Illantris

> Illantriss approaches the front next, guilt evident on her face as she addresses the attendants.
>
> ‚ÄúTheren‚Ä¶was a contentious person. I cannot say I liked him all that much when we met. I thought him too strict, too masked, too tightly tied to duty. I failed to see the intention and reason behind many of his actions and personality. So, I missed his unending care for others, his curiosity and ingenuity, and how deeply he treasured and cared for those important to him.
>
> _voice breaking for a second._
> I‚Ä¶am so sorry I failed him when he needed help. Help he gave to everyone, and in his moment of needing it, my best‚Ä¶wasn‚Äôt enough. Which. He would find completely unacceptable to remain as such. I can only promise his spirit that I will grow, improve, and protect those he loved as if they were my own.
>
> ‚Ä¶.and‚Ä¶I‚Äôm so‚Ä¶sorry. So sorry loves.‚Äù
>
> _tears brimming in her eyes, Illantriss leans down to kiss Reysatra on the head, and hugging Ni Ama quickly before moving to the back._

#### Bavazi

> _Bavazi steps up to the podium._
>
> "While I didn't know Theren too well I do know he was plenty things I am not."
>
> "He was so smart. You can tell that by all the papers on his desk in the infirmary. And he used those brains to help others. I respect him so much for that."
>
> "I too am responsible for his loss. I add that to my growing list of failures. It makes me question what it is I'm doing here."
>
> "But I took a quick trip across Lemuria. I saw so many people and creatures that can't protect themselves. And now Theren is not around to help them. So I dedicate myself once more in Theren's name to continue fighting evil. "
>
> "To anyone out there looking to hurt the weak: I am coming for you. The Lemurian Guild is coming for you. And you are not S.A.F.E!"
>
> _Bavazi takes out a little S.A.F.E. poster, folds it up, and slips it into Theren's pocket._
>
> _Bavazi turns his head to hide the fact that he is wiping a tear then steps down and walks to the back of the room._
>
> _Bavazi finds Ozryn in the room and goes over to him and gives him a big hug._

#### Eligos

> _Eligos is in his leathers; the absence of plate armor and his sagging wings shrink him. He sets a bouquet of gladioli with the rest of the arrangements at the funeral director‚Äôs discretion. He approaches Theren‚Äôs body and murmurs his words of remembrance. He tries to keep his voice down, but it carries in the quiet sniffling regardless (stealth 6; nat 1, so basically not private at all.),_
>
> ‚ÄúFarewell, Theren. I shall remember you for your graciousness. For your wisdom and unfailing dedication. For your readiness to help anyone you could. And,‚Äù Eligos looks sheepish, ‚Äúfor your interesting sense of humor. I learned a lesson about flowers from you, and hopefully the florist did not lead me astray. I imagine you would give us a period of mourning, then reprimand us for moping and wasting time on something that we have no control over. Perhaps all that will matter to you is this: Reysatra and Ni Ama will not be without support in your absence. Their wings are tired but not crippled; they can ride the slipstream until they‚Äôve recovered. Until then I ‚Äì we, their friends ‚Äì will take point. I have faith they will soar again... ... ·µÄ ∞·µâ ·∂¶‚Åø·∂†·∂¶ ≥·µê·µÉ ≥ ∏  ∑·∂¶À°À° ·∂†·µâ·µâÀ° ·µõ·µÉ·∂ú·µÉ‚Åø·µó  ∑·∂¶·µó ∞·µí·µò·µó  ∏·µí·µò ≥ ·µñ ≥·µâÀ¢·µâ‚Åø·∂ú·µâ ·µó ∞·µâ ≥·µâ‚Äù
>
> _Eligos looks to the podium, but the energy leaves him at seeing the sea of tearful mourners. He turns back to the casket and leaves a feather for him,_ ‚ÄúYour research will not be in vain.‚Äù
>
> _He takes a seat by Rikku._

#### Star and Suri

> _Star and Suri bring flowers and berries to the podium._
>
> _Star speaks first_ "So sorry about what happened Theren. May you rest in peace."
>
> _Suri speaks next_ "Theren, when you passed, I felt like I heard your final shout from where I was, though we partook in different missions that fateful day. You will be missed."

#### Ni Ama

> _slowly stands, oblivious to the presence and warmth of the hugs from the people around her. Cold as ice to the touch, she stares unseeing ahead, before making her way to Theren's body._
>
> "Time. There should have been more time. You were so strong. So proud. So infinitely precious...to me. Your mask was your armor, your shield, which protected a soul so kind, that you hid it. continuing on brokenly. I loved seeing you in the rare moments where you were simply yourself. I was honored and blessed in that. But.... fresh tears spill from pale blue eyes, now I know the pain of what it is to no longer have you. And it is almost more than I can bear. I pray...the stars guide your soul to its place...and that one day...I may find it."
>
> _like in so many other funerals, Ni Ama reaches her hand down into the coffin to entice flowers to grow. However, this time....none do. Her eyes widen slightly in horror, and looks at her frosted hands, as if only now realizing...she isn't Spring anymore._

> \<\<Wast fitting. she says bitterly....ema teuk "me" lina-ina rema Nostaarest. Rema saed....rema'd unu-unumind Leats phe was priti phe forgot. Vitili phe've forgotten, demant rema sotan't Leats. Phe sotan't rema.\>\>
>
> \[Translation\] "How fitting...you took "me" with you, My First and Only. You said...you'd remind me who I was when I forgot. But I've forgotten, and you can't bring me back. Like I can't bring you back." (sylvan speakers).
>
> _using water from a nearby glass, Ni Ama shapes it into a lily, and touches it, turning it to ice. She gently lays it on Theren's chest next to the seed, and presses a final kiss to his forehead. Wordlessly, she turns to Reysatra. Covering her hands with her sleeves, she offers them to Reysatra to help her up._

#### Balsabarkno

> _Balsa walks over to Theren's body_
>
> "I have never met you but I wish I did. You smelled like the wyrwood forests where I was born. You clearly were an exceptional man so let me try to give you a send-off worthy of an elvish hero."
>
> _Balsa paces about Theren‚Äôs casket and Balsa places a spirit totem at his feat. Starts chanting in spells and speaking to the animals in what fellow druids realize is Druidic. Torches and flames surrounding the Theren's casket begin to flicker one by one. Their flames slowly grow dimmer until they suddenly all flash into a bright flame. Each flame forms a unique image of Theren. One is of him studying. Another is of him sitting beside a tree and talking to his sister. Another sees him holding the hand of an Eladrin._ (cast **control flames**)
>
> "Life of the guild, bear witness to this paragon of faith. A brother of the forest was lost to us and let us mourn. There will never be another like him. LIFE OF LUMERIA I CALL YOU" (Uses Druid of the Shepard Circle ability: **Speech of the Woods **that allows all beasts to understand him and for him to understand them)
>
> _The totem begins to shine and a majestic, translucent blue unicorn emerges. A large fey Raven swoops down from the sky and caws into greating to everyone. Suddenly flocks of ducks, murders of crows, parliments of owls, rats, mice, ants, beetles, and all of the creatures that live in the garden come out._ (Uses Druid of the Shepard Circle abilities: **Spirit Totem **& **Wild Companion**
>
> "Friends of the forest, let us show respect to our forest brother."
>
> _The unicorn walks up to Theren's casket and bows. The unicorn touches Theren's Sapling and it begins to glow emerald green. The garden tree surrounding Theren's casket suddenly glow alight into a 1000 different shades of green. Each leaf glows a unique shade of green just like the thousand colors behind that singular, always smiling elf. The unicorn, Balsa, and forest creatures bow to Theren's casket._ (Cast **Fairie Fire**)
>
> "Theren leaves behind a sister and a lover. This death was too soon. It is right to feel sorrow but hope for he goes back to nature's embrace. And it is also right to feel RAGE. THEREN DID NOT NEED TO DIE YET. HIS FRIENDS DID NOT NEED HIM TO DIE"
>
> _Balsabarkno's healthy brown wood turns to a sickly greys. His head grows sinister antlers. His eyes turn crimson red. The funeral's green flames turn red hot with fury._ (cast **Primal Savagery**)
>
> "The circle of life comes for all with time but Theren's time should not have come yet. ≈Ç ‚Ç¥‚Ç≥…é ‚ÇÆ‚±ß≈Ç‚Ç¥ ƒê…Ü‚Ç≥‚ÇÆ‚±ß ‚Ç©‚Ç≥‚Ç¥ ‚Ç¶√ò‚ÇÆ ‚Ç±‚Ç≥‚±§‚ÇÆ √ò‚Ç£ ‚ÇÆ‚±ß…Ü ‚Çµ≈Ç‚±§‚Çµ‚±†…Ü. ‚±ß…Ü ‚Ç©‚Ç≥‚Ç¥ ‚ÇÆ‚Ç≥‚Ç≠…Ü‚Ç¶ ‚ÇÆ√ò√ò ‚Ç¥√ò√ò‚Ç¶" _Balsa and all of the animals howl into the sky._
>
> _With time Balsa's coloring returns to normal and his features return to a calm but tired expression. He looks at Ni Ama and Reysatra and smiles._ "Forest sisters, I hope the coming days treat you well."

#### Minimo

> Minimo goes over to offer Reystatra and Ni Ama Emotional support mouse services. Sir Giblet even scrambles up Reysatra‚Äôs side and cuddles her cheek.
