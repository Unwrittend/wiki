## Background

At 13 age, lance's father Landon came home rambling something. He was a magical researcher. He was interested in the concept of fusing dragons with a creatures and to trying to make people immortal. He was given materials from a unknown group but was given a deadline which drove him mad. He knocked Lance out. The next thing Lance remembers is being nursed back to health by a man named Thomas. He found Lance's body washed up on a riverbank barely breathing and then nursed him back to health. There is a period of 5 months he knows nothing about. When he were well enough to travel, he went to the nearest city and got in contact with a Guild representative. They questioned he and he realized he could recall nothing from the gaps in his memory. The Guild rep offered to set him up with an apprenticeship in town. However, he said he wanted to find his father and find out what happened to him. The Guild rep shared that if he really wanted to do that, he should go join the Lemurian Guild. After joining the Guild, Lance now suspects that his father was involved with the Syndicate.

Lance is known for being excpetionally lucky and blessed by Avrae.
