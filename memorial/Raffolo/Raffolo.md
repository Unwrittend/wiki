## Backstory

Lost.

It happened so long ago. An escape. A storm. A ship torn apart. His brothers cast into the sea. Had he done enough? Could he have saved them?

His travels sent him through so many lands, collecting trinkets and stories along the way. He would sail to any shore...except home. How could he? How could he face the truth, if it was what he feared? Either shame, or something worse.

Eventually he arrived in Faundell, needing a place to rest his shell. A family of wood elves took him in, welcoming him as one of his own, reminding him what he had once had. When the eldest headed off in search of opportunity and adventure, Raffolo followed after. Could he redeem himself of the failure he carried like an anchor around his neck? Could he earn back what he had lost?

## Death

Raffalo died to a vorpal rabbit on the notorious pirate island, the Isle of Rabbits.

As of the rescue of Lea, Cheya, and Gen from the Isle of Rabbits [IRL date: 2023-09-16], his body is in the vorpal rabbit's lair alongside Gaille and Bran's.

### Memorial - Last Words

#### Cecilla's Openning Words

> The Guild gathers to pay respects to the fallen. The air is even heavier than the last time as nine portraits are displayed on the stage. Cecilia looks more weary than you have ever seen her before. "There is always uncertainty in our line of work. We do our best to be prepared, to anticipate the situations we are sent into, but there are things we cannot know until we step onto the battlefield. There are dangers that lurk in the dark that will not be drawn out, and the only path forward is to march steadfast into the darkness and meet them. These brave nine souls did just that. Unsure of what they were to face, they took up arms in the defense of this great Kingdom, and they paid the price for it. We remember and honor the lives they gave."

#### Bavazi

> Bavazi steps to the front of the room.
> "I still can't believe we have lost Raffolo. Just the other day he was helping me with a mission in the Sherwood forest. As a fellow druid, there was so much for me to learn from him. And now he is gone. Taken away before his time. He will be missed."

#### Than

> “Here here!” Than shouts from the back of the room after Bavazi finishes his speech.
>
> “Smart as a whip that Tortle… devised a whole plan to save that forest! Was gonna give up some time and spells for some apes he never met…
>
> Raffolo was cool under pressure, but never rude. I’m sure his brothers will be welcoming him in a joyful reunion… and may his his found brother, Fenris, and all of us here carry on his memory.”

#### Fenris

> Fenris stops in and thanks the folks who spoke. Still struggling, he can only share a few brief words. “Raffolo was a really good friend. He was a really good guy. I can’t believe he’s gone, I…”
>
> Fenris pauses, overcome. He blinks. He mumbles an apology and quickly leaves the room.

#### Tar'kiz

> Tar'kiz makes an appearance "Raffolo was my first ally that I cast a beneficial spell on. Still the only one I think. He reminded me of an adorable clumsy uncle who's also a grandpa. May he body bring life to the plants around him, like the garden he loved so much. A bright red patch of flowers sprouts somewhere in a dark forest."

#### Illantriss

> a little later when most have left, Illantriss comes in, rather despondent, and sits in front of the portraits on the stage. “You know….I’m beginning to hate this room. It’s both the place that brings me the most pain, and yet gives me hope for the future”. looks at Lucy, Raffolo, and Bran’s portraits. “I’m…so mad you’re not here anymore. Each of you were people I considered treasured friends, people I looked up to and wanted to become. You showed me I didn’t have to be who I was, I was more than simply what I was born as, and that working together was always better than trying to go it alone. I just…sigh…I will miss you all. Terribly. I hope your rest is easy, and your new adventures burden-less.”
