## Memorial

### Fenris

> _Fenris steps solemnly to the podium._ "Ulgrim, you will be truly missed. I only knew you for a short while, but you became a true friend in that time. What impressed me so much was how, any time you had a misstep, you always confronted it head on, vowed to do better, and made right on whatever came next. You were always facing yourself back towards the light out of any darkness."
> I made a misstep on encouraging you to embark on a more dangerous mission, and though you were valiant as ever, you paid the ultimate price. I will honor your memory and legacy by vowing to be better, and making right on whatever comes next. Just as you would have done."

### Tar'kiz

> _Tar'kiz makes his way to Ulgrim's altar, places a hand carved wooden gear, and leaves while covering his face._

### Illantriss

> _Illantriss makes her way to the alter, small sack in hand_ "Ulgrim saved my life the first time we ever adventured together. He was the nicest dwarf paladin ever. We failed and won together many a time, growing the unlikely bond between a paladin and a bard, dwarf and elf. I feel a gaping hole in my heart knowing we shall never take up arms against the darkness side by side ever again. I will endeavor to carry on in his memory and take to heart the valuable lesson of proper handling of children. Rest easy my friend, and may the halls of your forebears welcome you home as the hero you are". _she places the sack gently on the alter. Nearby mourners smell popcorn and brownie bites wafting from the pouch._
