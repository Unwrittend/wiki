Level 10 Elf Necromancer Wizard.

Inheritor of Magic Brian's Staff, resident corpse interrogator, plant talker, and supplier of discounted health potions.

## Backstory

Gaille is a young elf who ran off before her naming ceremony to obtain more knowledge of world. She is a firm believer that those who do not know their history cannot learn from it and thus are doomed to repeat it. As such, uncovering lost knowledge and preserving it for future generations is one of her interests. Her delving into necromancy may have something to do with this pursuit of knowledge.

## Death

Gaille went to the Isle of Rabbits with Minimo, Ikey, and Eligos upon hearing that Cheya, Lea, and Gen were captured by pirates. When they get to the Vorpal Rabbit's lair, Gaille finds the skeletons of Raffalo, Bran, and a third body on the floor, unmoved from when they were eaten by the Vorpal Rabbit. The Vorpal Rabbit stood over the bodies staring at Gaille and the team. The team quickly leaves and saves Cheya, Lea, and Gen from a massive spider. However, Gaille notices **several** shining cards from the Deck of Many Things behind the Vorpal Rabbit.

In the final minutes before the portal pulled everyone back Gaille [misty stepped](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/misty-step) behind the Vorpal Rabbit, trying to reach for the cards. The Rabbit lunged. The Rabbit was faster. The portal called the rest of the team back as they saw Gaille's head explode from the Vorpal Rabbit's pounce.

### Memorial - Eulogies

#### Openning Words - Cecilla

> The Guild gathers in the memorial hall to pay respects to Gaille. Penelope places another beautiful painting up on the main stage. Cecilia is the first to speak. "Today we honor the life of Gaille, one of our veteran members. Gaille was driven and true to her convictions. She had a dream of pushing the boundaries and conceptions of necromancy to be a tool for good. We should all strive to follow her example to pursue our dreams and better the world around us."

#### Ozryn

> _Ozryn begins to step up to podium, hands clutching his spellbook, but retreats back to the crowd. He looks up towards Valoria’s memorial plaque, takes a deep breath and steps forward. _
>
> “H-hello… I went on a mission with Gaille once-to get back Rikku. She was focused, took great risk to bring back her friend.
>
> She was an accomplished alchemist as well, taking what she learned from Rikku to help others, often selling potions at lower prices so others could afford it.
>
> The guild suffers an incomprehensible loss… you will be missed Gaille, but never forgotten. W-we will carry on in your memory.”
>
> _Ozryn steps away from the podium and ambles back into the crowd._

#### Fierfiz

> _Feirfiz steps up,_
>
> "I remember when I first came to this guild. The very first mission I was on, was with Gaille and her undead entourage.
>
> At first I did not like her, for I've been told the undead are an abomination. But in time, she taught me that they are a tool - just as dangerous and potentially good or evil as enchantment or any other magic or weapon.
>
> It is a shuddering loss that she is gone now. Her insights and curiosity are irreplaceable.
>
> I will miss her. "

#### Gustabo

> _Gustabo steps up to the podium._

> “I went on many missions with Gaille. I still remember the mission where she acquired the cursed music box…”

> _He chuckles to himself._

> “We went on some grand adventures. I can’t believe I won’t see her and her undead minions attacking the enemy anymore. Gaille, you will be missed.”

#### Illantris

> _Illantriss steps up_
>
> “When I joined, Gaille’s name was whispered through the Guild halls with fear and reverence. The first time I adventured with her, I watched from a mostly unconscious spot on the ground as she single handedly obliterated Fey undead on three fronts around my downed body. Her zombies have cushioned my fall, skeletons taking blasts to the face for me, and her counter spells have saved my life on more than one occasion.

> _shakily_
>
> The loss of your presence is both shattering to the hearts of those who were so lucky as to know you, as it is to the strength and security of the Guild. You will be most keenly missed, and my heart breaks at your passing.”

#### Minimo

> _Sir Giblet drags a shaking Minimo by a shoelace to the coffin. Minimo keeps shaking until Sir Giblet takes out a tiny flute and begins playing a soft, emotional song that sounds like winter. With this, Minimo recovers his nerves and speaks._
>
> “Ahem."
>
> "You, Herald of the Green Lives, the Lifegiving Gravetender, are a friend of botany and are recognized by the Smallguard."
>
> "You, Lady of Undeath, Hero of a Lumeria are recognized by the Tallguard."
>
> "Gaille, Truth Seeking Scholar, you are recognized for the hundreds of stories you started, touched, and changed."
>
> "I barely got to know you but you were, no are, so much to everyone here, Gaille. Few people live long in our line of work and few have lived longer than you. As a fellow knowledge seeker, I have always admired your work and placed them among the greats like Tar'kiz. Few people are remembered after they are gone. Your name and story will be remembered by the people, and even plants, that you met."
>
> _Minimo joins Sir Giblet in the mournful song ['Until the End'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LF21VOQvzEs&ab_channel=Vindsvept%2Cfantasymusic)_

#### Eligos

> _Eligos's talons click against the flooring as he makes his way to the podium. The absence of a body berates him with failure. For a disorientating moment, he's not sure if he should address the audience or Gaille's spirit -- as he had addressed Bart's corpse only a week before._
>
> "I knew of Gaille before I met her. Her adventures were well documented and numerous. But the first time I met her, it was because she had offered her expertise to speak to Gen's mother. She heard we had a problem we couldn't solve on our own, and she jumped right in to aid us without hesitation. And it was the same with this last mission, her last mission.
>
> She acted selflessly and with great compassion for others. Lemuria lost a champion of good, and for many here today, a dear friend and stalwart companion.
>
> Gaille, your presence will be missed, but never forgotten. We'll bring your body back, someday, so your last wishes may be honored."

#### Red Paw

> _Red Paw walks solemnly up to the memorial._ "Gaille was a friend from the beginning. We joined the guild at the same time and went on many missions together. Her strength and desire to do good helped pull me through many hard times. Had she not been also held captive by the Syndicate with me, I doubt we would have been able to break free. She never shied from helping those she cared about. May she be remembered."
>
> _Red Paw turns and places a blue gem on the memorial then whispers something to the painting._
> "I know Runt would want you to have his sapphire to help guide your way."
>
> _Red Paw walks back to his seat, head hung low._
